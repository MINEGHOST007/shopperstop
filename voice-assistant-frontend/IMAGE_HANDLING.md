# Image Handling in the Application

## Local Image Assets

The application uses images for products from two sources:
1. Local images in `/public/assets/images/`
2. External images from `cdn.dummyjson.com`

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Local Image Placeholders

For missing local images like `sofa_default.png` and `mi_tv_default.png`, we've:
- Created placeholder images by copying `iphoneX.png` to ensure all referenced local images exist
- This was done using the `create-placeholders.js` script which detects missing references and creates placeholder copies

### 2. External Image Fallbacks

To prevent 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from `cdn.dummyjson.com`, we've:
- Added fallback image handling in `CombinedProductService.ts`
- Created a mapping of category-specific fallback images
- Modified the data loading process to replace external URLs with local fallbacks

## How It Works

1. When the application loads product data from `combined-products.json`
2. The service detects external URLs from `dummyjson.com` and replaces them with appropriate local fallbacks
3. Fallbacks are selected based on product category (e.g., electronics → iphoneX.png, furniture → sofa_default.png)
4. This prevents 404 and 429 errors while still maintaining category-appropriate visuals

## Future Improvements

For a production application, consider:
1. Downloading and properly hosting all required images locally
2. Implementing a proper image CDN with adequate rate limits
3. Adding image lazy loading and optimization techniques
4. Creating more representative placeholder images for each product category
